# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A personal secretary agent built with ADK for Go (`google.golang.org/adk`) + Gemini. The first feature is a Gmail triage agent: it classifies incoming mail into "needs review / unwanted / has schedule", labels unwanted mail, registers events in Google Calendar, and sends a summary via a Slack Bot (`chat.postMessage`), with needs-review mail linked to Gmail and calendar registrations linked to the event. The same agent also fetches, summarizes, and translates Go blog (`go.dev/blog/...`) posts on request — typically invoked via the Slack `@mention` listener. README.md (Japanese) has the full env-var table and setup walkthrough.

## Commands

```sh
go build ./...                       # build everything
go vet ./...                        # lint
golangci-lint run                   # additional lint (config: .golangci.yml); CI runs this via golangci-lint-action
go test ./...                       # tests (currently just internal/tools/goblog's HTML-extraction logic)

ACTION_MODE=dry_run go run ./cmd/batch                    # one-shot agent run, no real changes (mail triage, the default -command)
go run ./cmd/batch -command llm-cost-report               # post yesterday's LLM cost summary to Slack (needs MYSQL_DSN; no-op otherwise)
go run ./cmd/batch -command weekly-review                 # post the GTD weekly-review summary to Slack (needs MYSQL_DSN; no-op otherwise)
go run ./cmd/api web api webui                            # dev server with Web UI at :8080
go run ./cmd/oauth                                        # one-time local helper to obtain a refresh token
go run ./cmd/migrate -command up                          # create/update MySQL session + llm_usages tables (needs MYSQL_DSN)
```

Required env for the agent to actually run: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID/_SECRET/_REFRESH_TOKEN` (see README). Without `MYSQL_DSN` sessions are in-memory, which is fine locally. If `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`/`SLACK_APP_TOKEN` are set, `cmd/api` also starts a Slack Socket Mode listener (`internal/slackbot`) so the agent can be invoked by `@mention`ing the bot; otherwise it's skipped silently. Once a thread has been started with an `@mention`, plain messages in that same thread keep talking to the agent without another `@mention` — gated on the thread already having an ADK session and on the same `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_ID` check as mentions, so it can't make the bot respond in threads it was never invited into. The notify tool posts the summary via the same `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: when the request came in through the Slack listener it replies in that request's thread (channel/thread_ts are carried in session state, set by `internal/slackbot` at session creation), otherwise it posts top-level to `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`. If the token (or, for non-Slack triggers, `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`) is unset, notification is skipped (not an error).

**ADK launcher gotcha**: the `web` launcher requires its sublaunchers listed explicitly as args (`api`, `a2a`, `webui`). Omitting them fails with `no active sublaunchers found`. Prod runs headless via `ADK_LAUNCHER=prod ./api web api a2a` (the Dockerfile bakes this in as ENTRYPOINT/CMD).

## Architecture

Four entry points in `cmd/` share one dependency builder, `internal/app.Build()`, which assembles: Gemini model → Google OAuth clients (`internal/google`) → the gmail agent → session service. Anything wired into both the API server and the batch belongs there.

- `cmd/api` — always-on ADK REST API server (`POST /run`, `/run_sse`) for a k8s Deployment. Also owns the optional Slack Socket Mode listener (`internal/slackbot`), started as a goroutine alongside the ADK launcher — not wired into `internal/app.Build()` since only the API server needs it.
- `cmd/batch` — `-command mail` (default): one-shot `runner.Run()` invocation, triggered by an ArgoWorkflows CronWorkflow. Creates its own session (`cron-<timestamp>`) before running, because `runner.Run` requires an existing session. `-command llm-cost-report`: aggregates the previous day's LLM usage and posts a cost summary to Slack; does not call `internal/app.Build()` since it never touches Gmail/Calendar/Gemini. `-command weekly-review`: aggregates the current GTD task state (`internal/store.TaskStore`) via `internal/weeklyreview` and posts a summary to Slack; same no-`app.Build()`/no-op-without-`MYSQL_DSN` shape as `llm-cost-report`.
- `cmd/migrate` — schema migration, run as an ArgoCD PreSync Job before pods roll out.
- `cmd/oauth` — local-only refresh-token helper.

The agent (`internal/agents/gmail`) is an `llmagent` whose behavior is driven entirely by its instruction prompt (in Japanese — user-facing output is Japanese) plus function tools from `internal/tools/{gmail,calendar,notify,goblog}`. The instruction routes between two tasks based on what the caller asked for: the Gmail triage flow, or (given a `go.dev/blog/...` URL) fetching, summarizing, and translating a Go blog post via `goblog_fetch_post` — the tool only returns raw title/text; the LLM does the summarizing/translating itself. Safety is enforced at the tool layer, not just in the prompt — see `.claude/rules/action-mode-safety.md`. `goblog_fetch_post` is read-only and hard-restricted to the `go.dev` host to avoid becoming an open URL fetcher.

`internal/agents/llmauditor.go` and `image_generator.go` are standalone sample agents not wired into the app.

`internal/weeklyreview` builds the GTD weekly-review summary read by `cmd/batch -command weekly-review`: unprocessed inbox count, next/waiting tasks untouched for `Config.WeeklyReviewStaleDays` days ("stalled"), and a prioritized next-actions shortlist, all read from `internal/store.TaskStore`. Task prioritization itself (`store.SortByPriority` — overdue first, then soonest-due, then oldest-created with no due date) lives in `internal/store` so `internal/tools/tasks`'s `task_list` tool applies the same ordering when the agent is asked "what should I do now" interactively.

`internal/llmusage` measures Gemini token usage and estimated cost for every trigger surface in one place: `internal/app.Build()` wraps the `model.LLM` it constructs (`llmusage.WrapModel`) before handing it to the agent, so batch/Slack/API calls are all recorded through the same decorator regardless of which entry point is running. Per-call context is tagged with a `Trigger` (`llmusage.WithTrigger`, set explicitly by `cmd/batch` and `internal/slackbot`; anything untagged defaults to `TriggerAPI`) and priced against a `PricingTable` (`internal/config.Config.LLMPricingJSON` overrides the built-in defaults). `internal/store.UsageRecorder` is the MySQL-backed sink (table `llm_usages`, migrated by `cmd/migrate` alongside the ADK's own tables) and doubles as the read side for `cmd/batch -command llm-cost-report`'s daily aggregation; like the ADK's tables it needs `datetime(6)` timestamp columns per `.claude/rules/mysql-sessions.md`. A recording failure is logged and swallowed, never propagated — `internal/app.Build()` falls back to a no-op recorder rather than failing the whole app, which is intentionally more permissive than `store.NewSessionService`'s error handling right next to it.

## Rules

Situational invariants live in `.claude/rules/`:

- `action-mode-safety.md` — ACTION_MODE gating; applies when adding or changing agent tools.
- `tool-json-schema.md` — `omitempty`/nil-slice invariants for tool input/output structs; applies when adding or changing agent tools.
- `mysql-sessions.md` — timestamp-precision invariants in `internal/store`; applies when touching the store or upgrading the ADK module.
- `ci-cd-contract.md` — the cross-repo GitOps contract; applies when touching the workflow or Dockerfile.
